        "<p>LV= has over 5,700 employees 17 UK offices. The Ipswich office is a major claims handling centre for the firm‚Äôs motor insurance business, dealing with customer and third party claims including vehicle accent repairs and write-offs, fire and theft, personal injury and property claims. It is the firm‚Äôs centre of excellence for commercial motor insurance, including company car fleets, vans, trucks and private hire vehicles.¬†</p>\n\n<p>LV=‚Äôs presence in Ipswich began with its acquisition five years ago of the former Highway business, which at the time had around 90 people in the town. After a period of steady growth, the total has increased with a target of 450. Ipswich is now the second-largest claims centre within the group, the largest being in Bournemouth. </p>\n\n<p>Announcing the latest 120 person expansion in Ipswich, Peter Horton, the mutual firm‚Äôs chief operating officer, said Ipswich was chosen from among a number of options as a location for expansion because of the quality of the existing team‚Äôs performance. He was aware of Ipswich as a major centre for insurance and he praised the ‚Äúspirit and calibre‚Äù of the team at the LV= offices, and the high staff retention and low absenteeism figures being achieved</p>\n\n<p>.¬†</p>",

The life was way too good to end too soon‚Ä¶ but money was running short. A plan was needed‚Ä¶ design some sweatshirts, sell ‚Äòem at night, ski during the day, stick around till Spring then head for the beach. Fat Face had been born.<br /><br />\n\n\n\nWe've grown a bit since then, we sell more than just a few sweatshirts these days and we've got a few more stores. But one thing will never change; we design kit for those who love to get out there, stuff that‚Äôs built to withstand the demands of an active lifestyle. So, whether you‚Äôre into extreme sports or just enjoy getting out amongst it our clothes are proudly designed by our team in England with a focus on modern styling and ‚Äòhero‚Äô pieces for your wardrobe. <br /><br />\n\n\n\nWe care about the detail and we create clothes that are built to last, at prices you can trust. We wash them again and again, until they have that relaxed ‚Äòold favourite‚Äô feel, from new. We believe our clothes are washed in happiness, before they find their way to you. It‚Äôs what makes FatFace different. We like that and we hope you do too.¬†</p>",

It has also been commended on its nurturing and development of minority artists, as well as the success of their rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll pantomime.&nbsp;Recent musical revivals have included an actor-musician version of&nbsp;<em>Sweet Charity</em>, Jason Robert Brown‚Äôs&nbsp;<em>The Last Five Years</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Made in Dagenham</em>&nbsp;in co-production with Queen‚Äôs Theatre Hornchurch. They have joined forces with six other mid-scale theatres and Graeae to create Ramps on the Moon, an Arts Council funded strategic touring project, with the aim of increasing the engagement and participation of D/deaf and disabled actors, artists and audiences. 2017 saw their own production of The Who‚Äôs <em>Tommy&nbsp;</em>open in Ipswich before embarking on a national tour. There are a range of performances available, with new work presented in their annual PULSE Festival, work suitable for children and families in all seasons, as well as shows currently touring the UK.</p>\n\n\n<p>As a not-for-profit organisation and a registered charity, they are funded by the Arts Council England, Suffolk County Council and Ipswich Borough Council as well as through the invaluable donations, individual giving and corporate support of their many friends, patrons and sponsors.</p>\n\n\n<p>For more information and to book your tickets, please visit the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wolseytheatre.co.uk/\">website</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

        "\n\n\n\n<p>Urban Vintage opened February 2006 with a 1000 square foot store in the heart of Ipswich, it soon became a favourite destination for the fashion conscious individual. Since then the store has evolved quickly, bringing in a stream of new brands but also sticking with a few firm favourites. In December 2009 we moved to a new 1700 square foot site and only a year later extended to house a new premium section. In the last few years we have redesigned and refurbished the store to create an even more customer friendly environment.¬†</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2012 following being shortlisted finalists on three occasions we were winners of the UK's Best Young Fashion Store title at the prestigious Drapers Industry Awards. The store is judged from all aspects with a very high standard being required even for nomination. In 2012 and 13 we also finished 17th and 27th in the Drapers Inspiring Independents Awards, we believe this recognition is a result of our constant desire to evolve and provide the best possible service we can to our customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our main aim at Urban Vintage has always been to provide an enjoyable shopping experience for our customers whether shopping online or in store, we pride ourselves on our customer service and the fact we offer honest reliable advice. We feel that this is reflected in our customer database, which is growing rapidly but also retains the customers that have been loyal to us since the day we opened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are official stockists of all brands featured on our site, shop with us with confidence.</p>\n\n\n\nVisit the Facebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/UrbanVintageMenswear\">here</a>, Twitter <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/URBANVINTAGEMEN\">here</a>¬†and the Instagram <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/urbanvintagemenswear/\">here</a><br /><br /><br />",

In the 16th century the house was owned by a string of local merchants, including George Copping who acquired the property in 1567. It was Copping that commissioned the paneling of the ground floor room at the front of the house. He also built the 'long gallery'. The Sparrowe family became the owners of the house in 1603, and continued ownership for the next 300 years.</p>\n\n\n<p>The decorative plasterwork (pargeting) and carving added in the 17th Century is one of the finest examples in the UK. The interior includes 16th Century wall paintings and further examples of carving and pargeting, and is also home to occasional art displays and exhibitions. The building features four panels representing the continents of Africa, Asia, Europe and America, (Australia hadn‚Äôt, at the time, been discovered).</p>\n\n\n<p>The house also has the Royal Arms of King Charles II on the side of the building which was added in around 1660.</p>",

The church of the Dominicans, the Blackfriars, whose Friary of the Blessed Virgin lay to the south of Tacket Street, was excavated by archaeologists in the 1980s. Five monasteries once stood in Ipswich and none of them survives today. Only the ruins of the Blackfriars Monastery give an idea of what these medieval monasteries looked like while the others have completely disappeared. <br /><br />\n\n\n\nIn 1263, the Friary was founded and remained there for over 250 years. In the 16th Century, Henry VIII ordered to dissolve the monasteries and give their property to the state. After the closing in 1537, the monastery buildings were left standing - unlike their church of St. Peter and Paul whose ground was used to build a college. But in the 17th century they fell into disuse and some of them were quickly pulled down. After some decades, only the four arches of the Friary remained visible. It wasn‚Äôt until the 1980s that the rest of the monastery was uncovered again and preserved. These measures also uncovered one of only three surviving stone altar structures in Suffolk.",

This was partly due to the efforts of the controversial local MP, Richard Stokes, who campaigned for massive public air-raid shelters to be built under Alexandra Park.<br /><br />\n\n\n\nAfter the war, the shelter was sealed up and largely forgotten.  It was re-discovered in 1989, when workmen excavating a small pond for the school found one of the original entrances.  To everyone's surprise the tunnels were in first class condition.<br /><br />\n\n\n\nTo check out the opening times <a href=\"http://www.cliffordroadschool.org.uk/downloads/Clifford%20Road%20Air%20Raid%20Shelter%20Opening%20Times%202014.pdf\">Click here</a>",

Being in Ipswich allows Willis to take advantage of the high quality talent pool available in Suffolk, while still being close to the insurance capital of the world.<br /><br />\n\n\n\nHaving recently expanded to meet the demands of its growing business the company now employs 1,200 Associates in Ipswich with a further 100 people supporting the running of the Ipswich operation in functions such as IT, catering and security. Globally Willis has a network of offices in 90 countries and operates in over 130, with a global team of approximately 17,000 people serving clients throughout the world.<br /><br />\n\n\n\nMark Parker, Managing Director of Global Service Centres in Ipswich and Mumbai, has worked for Willis for 29 years in various operational roles and returned to his native Suffolk to take up his dream job in April 2011. He said:<br />\n\n\n\n‚ÄúDespite the less than optimistic growth forecasts for the world economy in 2013, with operations in every part of the world, Willis is ideally placed to take advantage of growth opportunities wherever they exist. At the end of the day, whatever the economic climate, business will always need insurance protection and we are in the business of offering what we like to call ‚Äúresilience‚Äù to our clients in an increasingly risky world. Insurance is the DNA of capitalism and our bespoke client solutions provide the bedrock that allows companies around the world to invest, innovate, create jobs and think long term. Our global platform helps with managing the economic ups and downs across different countries and regions. We are the first and biggest insurance broker in China and also have businesses in all main regions of the world including North America, Europe, Asia and Latin America‚Äù.¬†</div>",

Members of IAA will be on hand at these and other major events during the year to answer questions or point visitors in the direction of the voluntary arts sector in the area.<br>\n\n\nIAA also maintain The Ipswich Charter Hangings, which celebrate the towns history and mark the granting of the Royal Charter in 1200AD. They are on display at St Peters Church and continue to attract many visitors.<br>\n\n\nIAA is also a campaigning organisation and, at a time when there are widespread cuts and challenges, it is raising questions about public resources including libraries, concert venues as well as the quality of arts provision in schools. Many of these topics form the basis for discussion at the&nbsp; General Meetings held three times a year, in Ipswich, to which anyone is invited- whether or not they are involved with a local society.<br>\n\n\nThe website is one of a number of ways in which IAA aims to keep in touch not only with it‚Äôs members but also with the wider community. It provides an excellent way for societies to publicise their events as well as a diary of proposed events, which has long proved invaluable to those keen to avoid clashes with other events of the same kind or in the same locality.<br>\n\n\nIn addition to helping to promote the work of IAA members, IAA publishes the IAA News & Events brochure, three times a year.&nbsp; This is circulated to Tourist Information Centres, Libraries and other appropriate public places as well as to&nbsp;all member groups.&nbsp; For more details visit&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.ipswich-arts.org.uk\">http://www.ipswich-arts.org.uk</a></p>\n\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>",

        "<p><strong>With Harwich being so easily accessible by road, train and boat; The Pier is perfectly&nbsp;</strong><strong>situated on the quay in the heart of the old town.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n<p>The brasserie is located on the first floor, and is open from 12 noon every day until 9.30 pm and there‚Äôs no need to book which is very useful if you are arriving by water. The menu celebrates modern classics and wonderful fresh fish and shellfish landed on The Pier‚Äôs doorstep. With estuary views from every table, The Pier, only a stone‚Äôs throw from the confluence of the Stour and Orwell estuaries is a very special destination for lovers of great food and drink.</p>\n\n\n<p>The harbour wall is only 20 metres from the door and The Pier‚Äôs first floor balcony overlooks the water, ships and working docks at Felixstowe and when the sun is shining and the wind in the right quarter there can be no better place to enjoy lunch or dinner.</p>\n\n\n<p>The NAVY√ÑRD Bar on the ground floor is adjacent to the working harbour, the ideal place for fun and relaxation and is fast becoming famous for the Gin Library of over 130 gins (and growing). The NAVY√ÑRD is open from 9.00am for coffee, breakfast and sm√∂rg√•sbord open sandwiches (there‚Äôs usually a special on the bar too, such as millionaires‚Äô shortbread).</p>\n\n\n<p>To complete the picture, The Pier has 14 bedrooms many of which have fine views<br>over the estuaries which means you can stay and enjoy the beautiful sunsets and<br>breakfast in the morning!</p>\n\n\n<p></p>",

        "<p><strong>The Suffolk Coast & Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) is an outstanding landscape along the Suffolk and north Essex coast, including the wildlife-rich estuaries of the Stour and Orwell that frame the Shotley peninsula.\n\n\n</strong></p>\n\n\n<p>Harwich Haven is the best natural harbour on the east coast of England. The very first English settlers to colonise America left Ipswich aboard the ‚ÄòGodspeed‚Äô and the ‚ÄòDiscovery‚Äô with Captain Bartholomew Gosnold in 1607, saying farewell to Suffolk from the river Orwell.\n\n\n</p>\n\n\n<p>The AONB is 155 square miles of tranquil and unspoilt landscape, considered valuable of being conserved and enhanced for future generations. Within the southern part of the AONB the Shotley peninsula is important for it‚Äôs wildlife and vistas, and is an area celebrated by artists, poets and writers.\n\n\n</p>\n\n\n<p>The Stour and Orwell estuaries contain mudflats and saltmarsh which are a haven for wading birds. Every autumn 40,000 wildfowl and wading birds make an incredible journey to feed and roost here. Migrating birds, such as sandpiper and greenshank, are present in spring and autumn. Drainage dykes inland of the river walls provide a vital habitat for insects, including the Emperor Dragonfly, the largest in the UK.\n\n\n</p>\n\n\n<p>For those interested in walking and exploring AONB Walk and Cycle Explorers can be downloaded for free from&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.suffolkcoastandheaths.org/publications\" target=\"_blank\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-GB&q=http://www.suffolkcoastandheaths.org/publications&source=gmail&ust=1528880322258000&usg=AFQjCNE3MXKZL5-WMshbeliKvgCGqA_Lpw\">www.suffolkcoastandheaths.org/publications</a>.

It starts here on the Shotley Peninsula at Pin Mill ‚Äì ‚Äúdown the deep green lane that ended in the river itself&hellip; this happy place where almost everyone &nbsp;wore sea-boots‚Äù. &nbsp;The four children, the ‚ÄòSwallows‚Äô, help to moor up a yacht, the <em>Goblin</em>, remarkably similar to the <em>Nancy Blackett</em>, and soon they are off sailing her down the river and mooring off Shotley Pier for the night.<br></p>\n\n\n<p><em>Nancy Blackett</em> was rediscovered, damaged and derelict, in Scarborough Harbour in the 1980s. She was brought back here, to Fox‚Äôs marina, and carefully restored to the condition Ransome and the children in his book would have recognised.</p>\n\n\n<p>Now she is owned by the Nancy Blackett Trust, which preserves and maintains her, and keeps her sailing for the benefit of all Ransome fans. Her sailing is undertaken with qualified volunteer skippers, with a mix of pre-planned programme and odd days, which members (anyone can become a member) can book for daysails or short trips. She is now berthed at Woolverstone Marina, Woolverstone, Ipswich.</p>\n\n\n<p>You can also enjoy the Arthur Ransome Trail, with geocaches, which follows the <em>Goblin</em>‚Äôs course alongside the Orwell from Pin Mill to Shotley Pier, and our exhibition of Arthur Ransome‚Äôs ‚ÄòSelina King ‚Äò photos at the Pin Mill Studio.<br></p>",
